The only problem I have with the result of autograder is that everything has to do with multiple pages does not work for me. Specifically, those tests are 00-pages.tx, 01-pages.tx, 02-pages.tx, 02-endnote.tx and 03-endnote.tx in the autograder tests. I've tried a lot of ways to handle the errors but none of them passed. The method that handles page breaks is my close() in Controller.java. I really want to know what is wrong. Thank you.
